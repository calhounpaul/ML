The animal appears to be at rest or possibly swimming in this position, which is not uncommon for axolotls due to their unique swimming style. They are known for being able to regenerate limbs and other body parts if they are damaged. Axolotls are often kept as pets due to their unique characteristics and adaptability to captivity.",
