Let's tackle this word. It's pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis. Wow, that's a mouthful. I need to count how many times the letter "c" appears in it. Okay, first things first, I should probably write it down to make sure I don't miss any letters.

Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis.

Alright, now, I know that "c" can make different sounds depending on the context, but for this task, I just need to count the occurrences of the letter itself, not worry about the sounds it makes. So, I'll go through the word slowly and pick out each "c".

Let's break it down into smaller parts to make it easier.

First part: pneumono ul tra micro scopic silico volcano con iosis.

Wait, maybe that's not the best way to split it. Let me try again.

Pneumono - ultra - micro - scopic - silico - volcano - con - iosis.

Hmm, perhaps that's better.

Now, I'll look at each segment:

1. Pneumono: No "c"s here.

2. Ultra: No "c"s.

3. Micro: One "c".

4. Scopic: One "c".

5. Silico: One "c".

6. Volcano: One "c".

7. Con: One "c".

8. Iosis: No "c"s.

So, from that, I've found "c"s in micro, scopic, silico, volcano, and con. That's five "c"s in total.

But wait, I should double-check because it's easy to miss one in such a long word.

Let me go through it again:

Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis.

I'll scan the entire word letter by letter.

P-n-e-u-m-o-n-o-u-l-t-r-a-m-i-c-r-o-s-c-o-p-i-c-s-i-l-i-c-o-v-o-l-c-a-n-o-c-o-n-i-o-s-i-s.

Okay, let's highlight the "c"s:

- micro: c

- scopic: c

- silico: c

- volcano: c

- con: c

- And wait, in "coniosis," there's another "c".

Wait, I didn't consider "coniosis" before. Let me look at that.

Coniosis: c-o-n-i-o-s-i-s. There's a "c" there.

So, that would make it six "c"s in total.

But hold on, in my first breakdown, I split "coniosis" as "con" and "iosis," and I counted "c" in "con," but maybe "coniosis" is a separate segment.

Let me check the word again.

Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis.

Yes, it's volc-ano-con-iosis.

So, "coniosis" is a separate part, and there is a "c" in "coniosis."

Therefore, "micro" has one "c," "scopic" has one "c," "silico" has one "c," "volcano" has one "c," "con" has one "c," and "coniosis" has one "c."

That's six "c"s in total.

But, in "coniosis," the "c" is part of "conio," so perhaps I double-counted the "c" in "con."

Wait, in the word, it's "volcanoconiosis." So, "volcano" ends with "o," and "coniosis" starts with "c." So, it's two separate "c"s.

Therefore, it's indeed six "c"s.

To be absolutely sure, let's count them one by one:

1. micro: c

2. scopic: c

3. silico: c

4. volcano: c

5. con: c

6. coniosis: c

Yes, six "c"s in total.

I think that's the correct count.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{6} \]
